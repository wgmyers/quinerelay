==========

A simple quine relay, inspired by [this astonishing work of art](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay), which I discovered [via Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/130059/yo-dawg).

Mine just consists of some Python which emits some Perl which emits the original Python.

The `quines` subdirectory contains the single-language quines used to construct the relay.

More Quine Stuff
----------------

There's some interesting discussion of quines [here](http://johannesloetzsch.de/software/quines/)

What Is This Doing On Github?
-----------------------------

Nothing much, but I've some serious projects I'll be needing to put here soon so I thought I'd first upload something less serious to play about with and figure out how it all works.

Oh I See
--------

Yeah.

Nothing to see here, move on etc...
