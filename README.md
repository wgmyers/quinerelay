# quinerelay

A simple quine relay, inspired by [this astonishing work of art](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay), which I discovered [via Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com/130059/yo-dawg).

When I first posted this (the `qrelay` files) it just consisted of some Perl which emits some Python which emits the original Perl. Or the other way around.

But, since I've been playing around with Ruby, there's now also a threeway version (`qrelay2`) in which you get some Perl that emits some Python that emits some Ruby that emits the original Perl.

I'm probably going to stop now.

Anyway. The `quines` subdirectory contains the single-language quines used to construct the relay.
